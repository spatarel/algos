I solved many algorithm problems on various sites. To save some time, I wrote a
few classes that wrap up some of the frequenly occurring algorithms that I need
to solve the problems.

Every cpp file contains one or more classes that can help solve a specific type
of problem. Writing the code in such a way, makes it easy to copy-paste it in
a source-file that will solve a particular problem.

I'm considering rewriting the code in an industry-standard way, if it turns out
that my code is of interest to people outside the competitive programming world.
